# <Music-Tracker>

## Description

This application was made for people who need a convenient way to discover events happening on any given date at any given location. Instead of having to 
rely on multiple sources/platforms, users can simply put in their desired location/date and get access to a large list of artists that are performing in
that specific area, alongside the times and a map of the surrounding area.

The main problem that is being solved by making this application is the difficulty that comes with finding the specifics as to who, where, and when there 
are performances in a specific area. By using the Ticketmaster API and the Google Maps API, users can easily search for events in an area and recieve
the information that they need to make an informed decision.

## Usage
